### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**quinhaz/quinhaz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: getting Copilot for VSCode (that's why I created this repository)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: CSS, C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: AI projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Chinese apprentice
